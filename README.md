# congenial-party

This was originally a way for me to mess around with GitHub hosting, but turned into my personal resume webpage.

This page is created using [Ryan Balieiro](https://github.com/ryanbalieiro/vue-resume-template)'s template.

## TODO

This is based on a template and still has a lot of old data in it. Known issues that need to be corrected:

- [x] Update profile picture
- [ ] Update name
- [x] Update short bio
- [ ] Update short bio
- [ ] Remove unused languages
- [ ] Update Social Links
