# congenial-party

This was originally a way for me to mess around with GitHub hosting, but turned into my personal resume webpage.

This page is created using [Ryan Balieiro](https://github.com/ryanbalieiro/vue-resume-template)'s template.

## TODO

This is based on a template and still has a lot of old data in it. Known issues that need to be corrected:

- [x] Update workflow to include build step (thus removing the node_modules and dist folders)
- [x] Update profile picture
- [ ] Update name
- [x] Update short bio
- [x] Update short bio
- [ ] Remove unused languages
- [x] Update Social Links
- [x] Find Icons for past jobs
- [x] Update Experience page
- [ ] Find Icons for School
- [ ] Update Education page
- [x] Remove language selection
- [ ] Update footer to give credit to Ryan for the template: src/vue/navigation/default/NavSidebar.vue
- [x] Add ability to remove unused sections of the resume (ie portfolio)
